  <h1>A Poverty Crisis That is Being Ignored</h1>

    It is often difficult for Sameth Mell to speak about himself and his family on a warm Saturday morning in White
    Center, Seattle, Washington. He pauses to piece through a partially known past, is interrupted by his own thoughts,
    stopped short by painful memories, choked by tears and grief.

    This mainstream idea that Asian Americans are a prosperous monolithic group, however, is dangerously homogenizing,
    warned Professor Karthick Ramakrishnan, Professor and Associate Dean at the School of Public Policy, UC Riverside,
    and founder of AAPI Data. “Most of the discourse is about high-achievement and how successful Asians are,” he said,
    “There is an element of truth to those statements but people often stop there…[which] can mask the wide variation in
    the community.” The reality is that Asian American poverty is actually growing, and there are Asian American
    subgroups who are astoundingly poor.

      Although Asian-Americans have perceptions of attaining great wealth (which is true to some extent),
      Hmong-Americans deviate significantly
      from this preconceived idea. While the average household salary for an American is $57617, the average income for
      a Hmong-American is only $48000. Their earning characteristics are very similar to that of Hispanics/Latinos at
      $46882.

      Poverty rate has been decreasing in recent years, and was an average of 11.8% in 2017. Asian-Americans did indeed
      tend to have lower rates of poverty, but Hmong-Americans had incredible rates of poverty. In fact, if they were
      their own ethnic group, they'd rank first in poverty by a considerable margin. The Hmong's poverty rate is at a
      staggering 37.8%.

      College education is a rarity for the Hmong. While Asians are stereotypically well-educated (and while they are
      the most educated by a large margin), the Hmong are not and are considerably below average when it comes to the
      rate at receiving a upper-education degree. The average across all Americans is 31%, but the Hmong achieve a
      Bachelor's degree or higher at just 18%.

      Although unemployment rate is generally low in the states, Hmong-Americans suffer a disproportinate amount of
      unemployment. The typical American has an unemployment rate of just 4.9%, but the Hmong double that and have an
      unemployment rate of 10%.

      Programs aren't being made for these groups because no one even knows they exist. When people hear "Asian" they
      think very well off and educated, but this doesn't apply to everyone.

        <p>The jist of this problem is basically given some target number and an unsorted array of numbers, find the
          pair of numbers that sum up to our
          target.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the sake of brevity, I'm not going to consider the sorted case and the 2-pointers method: I'll save that
          for when I make a post on 3-Sum. If that made no sense, don't worry about it for now.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='step' data-step='2' style='height: 500px;'>
        <p>
          Let's consider the array <b>[4,3,5,12,7,1,9]</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For small arrays/small numbers, it's generally pretty easy to find the answer for any target.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if our target was 19, it's pretty obvious which 2 numbers sum to 19, that being 12 and 7.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, our solution for this would be <b>[3,4]</b> (representing the indicies of our solutions).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='step' data-step='3' style='height: 500px;'>
        <p>The naive solution should be quite easy to understand: simply try out every possible pair of numbers until
          we get our target.
        </p>
        <p>
          One implementation of this idea would be to start with 4, then check 3, 5, 12, 7, 1, 9, and then iterate to 3,
          and check 5, 12, 7, 1, 9, then to 5 and check 12, 7, 1, 9, and so on.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div class='step' data-step='4'>
        <p>
          Let's start with our first element '4' and ask ourselves what implications would there be is 4 was a solution.
          If 4 was part of the solution pair, then it would mean that there must exist 15 somewhere
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='step' data-step='5' style='height: 500px;'>
        <p>
          Instead of checking every combination, it's enough to check if the array contains an element and its
          complement. That is, everytime we iterate through
          the array and consider some element, we only need to check if the complement also exists.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='step' data-step='6' style='height: 380px;'>
        <p>
          Going back to our example, when we consider the element '3', we only have to see if its complement (16) exists
          in the array. It doesn't,
          so it obviously can't be part of the solution. However, once we reach the element '7,' we check to see if its
          complement (12) exists. It does,
          so 12 and 7 must be our solution.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='step' data-step='7'>
        <p>We introduce a hash table to keep track of what elements we have seen (and thus know to exist). Since at the
          start we haven't seen any numbers,
          the hash table is blank, and we assume nothing about the existence of a element's complement.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='step' data-step='8'>
        <p>Start with our first element 4 -- 4's complement (15) is not in our hashtable (so for now we assume it
          doesn't exist), so we don't have our solution.
          We have now seen the #4 and need to record that, so we insert it into our hash table.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='step' data-step='9'>
        <p>Now we go to 3 -- again, 3's complement (16) is not in our hashtable. we have now seen 3 and record that, so
          we insert it into our hash table.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='step' data-step='10'>
        <p>Now we go to 5 -- it's complement is 14 and isn't in the hashtable. We record 5 and keep going.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='step' data-step='11'>
        <p>We go to 12 -- 12's complement is 7 and 7 isn't in our hashtable. Remember, even though we personally know 7
          is in our array,
          the computer hasn't seen it yet (so to the computer, it doesn't exist yet). We don't have a solution yet,
          so we record it in our hashtable and keep going.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='step' data-step='12' style='height: 380px;'>
        <p>We go to 7. 7's complement is 12, and we (and the computer) have seen 12 before (it's in our hashtable).
          Because of this, we now have our solution and we didn't have to check every combination.
          We now know the solution are the array indicies of 7 and 12.
