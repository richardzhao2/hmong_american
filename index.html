  <h1>A Poverty Crisis That is Being Ignored</h1>

    It is often difficult for Sameth Mell to speak about himself and his family on a warm Saturday morning in White
    Center, Seattle, Washington. He pauses to piece through a partially known past, is interrupted by his own thoughts,
    stopped short by painful memories, choked by tears and grief.
  </p>

  <p style="color:rgb(100, 107, 107); font-size:15px;" ;>
    Sameth is an Asian American who has lived in the greater Seattle area since he was three years old. Asians in
    America are commonly stereotyped as economically successful, very educated and socially mobile. But Sameth’s lived
    experience defies the stereotype. He is a Vietnam/Hmong refugee who grew up poor in the United States.
  </p>

  <p style="color:rgb(100, 107, 107); font-size:15px;" ;>
    Upon arrival to the U.S., the family was placed by housing services in a cramped one-bedroom apartment in Tukwila,
    Washington. Eventually they moved to a slightly less cramped three-bedroom apartment in High Point, a housing
    project by the Seattle Housing Authority, where Sameth spent most of his childhood. The number of family members
    residing in this second apartment shifted occasionally but at the highest point, eight people lived there all
    together.

    The Mell family story of struggle and hardship is not what most Americans think of when they hear “Asian American.”
    The typical story is one of glamorous Asian and immigrant success, infused with wealth and high educational
    achievement.

      Although Asian-Americans have perceptions of attaining great wealth (which is true to some extent),
      Hmong-Americans deviate significantly
      from this preconceived idea. While the average household salary for an American is $57617, the average income for
      a Hmong-American is only $48000. Their earning characteristics are very similar to that of Hispanics/Latinos at
      $46882.

      Poverty rate has been decreasing in recent years, and was an average of 11.8% in 2017. Asian-Americans did indeed
      tend to have lower rates of poverty, but Hmong-Americans had incredible rates of poverty. In fact, if they were
      their own ethnic group, they'd rank first in poverty by a considerable margin. The Hmong's poverty rate is at a
      staggering 37.8%.

      College education is a rarity for the Hmong. While Asians are stereotypically well-educated (and while they are
      the most educated by a large margin), the Hmong are not and are considerably below average when it comes to the
      rate at receiving a upper-education degree. The average across all Americans is 31%, but the Hmong achieve a
      Bachelor's degree or higher at just 18%.

      Although unemployment rate is generally low in the states, Hmong-Americans suffer a disproportinate amount of
      unemployment. The typical American has an unemployment rate of just 4.9%, but the Hmong double that and have an
      unemployment rate of 10%.

      Programs aren't being made for these groups because no one even knows they exist. When people hear "Asian" they
      think very well off and educated, but this doesn't apply to everyone.
