  <h1>A Poverty Crisis That is Being Ignored</h1>

    It is often difficult for Sameth Mell to speak about himself and his family on a warm Saturday morning in White
    Center, Seattle, Washington. He pauses to piece through a partially known past, is interrupted by his own thoughts,
    stopped short by painful memories, choked by tears and grief.

    This mainstream idea that Asian Americans are a prosperous monolithic group, however, is dangerously homogenizing,
    warned Professor Karthick Ramakrishnan, Professor and Associate Dean at the School of Public Policy, UC Riverside,
    and founder of AAPI Data. “Most of the discourse is about high-achievement and how successful Asians are,” he said,
    “There is an element of truth to those statements but people often stop there…[which] can mask the wide variation in
    the community.” The reality is that Asian American poverty is actually growing, and there are Asian American
    subgroups who are astoundingly poor.

      Although Asian-Americans have perceptions of attaining great wealth (which is true to some extent),
      Hmong-Americans deviate significantly
      from this preconceived idea. While the average household salary for an American is $57617, the average income for
      a Hmong-American is only $48000. Their earning characteristics are very similar to that of Hispanics/Latinos at
      $46882.

      Poverty rate has been decreasing in recent years, and was an average of 11.8% in 2017. Asian-Americans did indeed
      tend to have lower rates of poverty, but Hmong-Americans had incredible rates of poverty. In fact, if they were
      their own ethnic group, they'd rank first in poverty by a considerable margin. The Hmong's poverty rate is at a
      staggering 37.8%.

      College education is a rarity for the Hmong. While Asians are stereotypically well-educated (and while they are
      the most educated by a large margin), the Hmong are not and are considerably below average when it comes to the
      rate at receiving a upper-education degree. The average across all Americans is 31%, but the Hmong achieve a
      Bachelor's degree or higher at just 18%.

      Although unemployment rate is generally low in the states, Hmong-Americans suffer a disproportinate amount of
      unemployment. The typical American has an unemployment rate of just 4.9%, but the Hmong double that and have an
      unemployment rate of 10%.

      Programs aren't being made for these groups because no one even knows they exist. When people hear "Asian" they
      think very well off and educated, but this doesn't apply to everyone.
